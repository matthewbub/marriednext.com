Always use the schadcn/ui library

Components should always be as dumb as possible, all the data they get comes from the backend via props. Use the least amount of reactivity as possible.

When creating new components create a storybook page (.tsx) as well as a default state for the component in Storybook. We need to ensure A11Y compliance.
