Over time, we began doodling on it each time we traded it. That simple, shared dollar became something special, and we've been inseparable ever since.",

          'Mat told me we were heading up to Lookout Peak to show Daniel and his wife Daisy the beautiful view while they were in town. To me, it felt like just a fun evening—I had no idea what was about to happen, so of course we weren\'t dressed up for the occasion. When we arrived, the sky had the most beautiful sunset. I smiled at Mat and said, "This is the exact spot where you asked me to be your girlfriend." In that instant, he gently took both of my hands, and I immediately knew. He was proposing. My heart raced, time stood still, and in that perfect moment, nothing else mattered.',
